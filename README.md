# A introduction to implementations and basic algorithms for each data structure. I will be adding a section on sorting algorithms later. If you have any questions regarding the material and would like more explanations send me a Slack message or get in touch with me at baeddavid@gmail.com. I am more than happy to help explain these concepts in more detail as this is more of a general overview

Best of luck with your studies.
